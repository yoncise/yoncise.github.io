title: Major GC or Full GC?
---
What's the difference between Major GC and Full GC?

Well, in some contexts, they mean the same thing: a full heap garbage collection. However, it would be more accurate to say that Major GC refers to a specific garbage collection targeting the Old Generation, for example, CMS is a well-known garbage collector that operates only on the Old Generation.
