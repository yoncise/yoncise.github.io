title: Java CPU Usage Spikes Periodically
---
Recently, I noticed that when our servers run continuously for about two weeks, the CPU usage gets very high periodically. At first, I thought there were some scheduled tasks causing this, but we couldn't find any. So, I used the following command to see which threads were causing the high CPU usage:
```shell
top -Hp <pid>
```
I found that the top threads were C2 CompilerThread and C1 CompilerThread. Then, I used jinfo to turn on the `PrintCompilation` flag:
```shell
jinfo -flat +PrintCompilation <pid>
```
We saw a lot of `made zombie` and `code cache is full` messages in the `stdout` log. We can now confirm that the high CPU usage is caused by JIT repeatedly deoptimizing and optimizing. To fix this, we can increase the code cache size with the JVM argument `ReservedCodeCacheSize`, which defaults to 240M.
