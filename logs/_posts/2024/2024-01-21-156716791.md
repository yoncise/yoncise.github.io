What part of Columbia are those French toaster sticks from?

Your team scored two goals all season.

I'm not taking a big risk.

Mmm, there is a first-inside out and backwards.

Well, there's book smart and there's street smart.

Daddy, we're scoring a touchdown!

Please don't _spike_ our baby.

Why is she dressed like a _Hamburglar_?

She's a _referee_.

I collect antique _fountain pens_.

I'm quite _adept_ at Japanese flower arrangement - ikebana - and I was a _starting offensive lineman_ at University of Illinois.

I thought part of being in a relationship was pretending to enjoy your parter's interest.

Would you care for a sack of _pickles_?

Stay home with you little jagged scissors. Maybe catch up on your _scrapbooking_.

Don't do the "double questiion to prove a point" thing.

We'll be right down.

Luke got in a fight.

I'm golfing.

Kid's a _menace_.

I _slept it on funny_.

These two _knuckleheads_ were fighting each other.

Could've been worse.

Well, apparently there was a some _name-calling and shoving_ on the playground.

I'm getting the sense that you're all related.

Here's your note for Miss _Passwater_.

What's weird is that her kid wears _aftershave_ and dresses like a _count_.

Just sweep it under the rug.

I think you two need to talk it out.

I just hate it when my two girs aren't getting along.
