What part of Columbia are those French toaster sticks from?

Your team scored two goals all season.

I'm not taking a big risk.

Mmm, there is a first-inside out and backwards.

Well, there's book smart and there's street smart.

Daddy, we're scoring a touchdown!

Please don't _spike_ our baby.

Why is she dressed like a _Hamburglar_?

She's a _referee_.

I collect antique _fountain pens_.

I'm quite _adept_ at Japanese flower arrangement - ikebana - and I was a _starting offensive lineman_ at University of Illinois.

I thought part of being in a relationship was pretending to enjoy your parter's interest.

Would you care for a sack of _pickles_?

Stay home with you little jagged scissors. Maybe catch up on your _scrapbooking_.

Don't do the "double questiion to prove a point" thing.

We'll be right down.

Luke got in a fight.

I'm golfing.

Kid's a _menace_.

I _slept it on funny_.

These two _knuckleheads_ were fighting each other.

Could've been worse.

Well, apparently there was a some _name-calling and shoving_ on the playground.

I'm getting the sense that you're all related.

Here's your note for Miss _Passwater_.

What's weird is that her kid wears _aftershave_ and dresses like a _count_.

Just sweep it under the rug.

I think you two need to talk it out.

I just hate it when my two girs aren't getting along.

With the bad ankle, I don't know how he's gonna run his corner routes.

That's very _elitist_ of you.

I'm taking a baby steps here, all right?

It's the bands and the drama, the _pageantry_.

Don't forget about the _team mascots_.

They wear _ascots_?

I'll be in here.

I think we should _address the elephant in the room_.

_Huddle up._

Now in light of what happened at school today, do you have any feelings you'd like to express?

I'll be in the _den_.

There's tension between you two.

Let's go, Illini.

He's one of the greatest _linebackers_ to every play at Illinois.

Dad I thought you were being _homophobic_.

He's been studying up.

That's low.

_Blitzing_ wouldn't have helped them.

So, my interest in football ended as suddenly and dramatically as the _climax_ of West Side Story.

Hey, there are the little _roustabouts_. You look like you patched things up pretty good, huh?

What's a coal digger?

Well, she's _pissed_.

Then you got a _lumpy_ rug.

Creates a tripping _hazard_.

You open yourself up to _lawsuits_.

Boy, you can go a really long time without blinking.

I was golden.

She'll be your most loyal friend you've ever had.

So we're _torn_.

I don't know, check me out?

But for the record, I think you're _smokin' hot_.

You're dangerous, you're getable, you have a little "cashola" in your pocket.

The whole kit and _caboodle_, I think.

I might have _lowballed_ a little bit.

Touchy.

Obviously I'm trying to _seduce_ him for his money.

I mean, you don't expect to wake up one morning with a new mom who looks like she fell off a mud flap.

Oh, you mean go jump in a lake.

Cannonball!

I'm really trying to _block it out_.
