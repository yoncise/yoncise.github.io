It was a _slumber_ party, not a gang fight.

You know, honey, there's a gun in the _footlocker_ in the garage.

Now that is a _scone_.

The refrigerator magnets rearranged themselves into a pentaâ€”

Tai chi. I did it every day in Sedona

She gave me a piece of exercise equipment and a _lettuce_ dryer.

So, to recap, I gave her a gorgeous pair of diamond earrings and she gave me a hint.

And living in Sedona has been transformational.

I go to a _Vortex_ meditation site and work with a _shaman_ to finally understand how to live my _spirituality_.

They kept _patting_ mu butt.

Somebody's full of herself.

Nana got totally wasted.

He couldn't wait 10 minutes to run off with Charo.

What, did you take your Claire pill?

During my vows to my first husband, drug dealers burst in and _assassinated_ the judge.

...especially that 17-year-old _hormone_ you are dating.

I'll be sure to include that in my AMBER Alert

He's in a band, okay? They're going on tour.

Why are you always on me about everything?

I thought it was _my funny take_ on current events.

Guys _pull pranks_ like that all of the time. You just gotta prank'em back.

You just gotta show'em you're willing to give as good as you get.

Well, Mom, instread of _dredging up_ the whole incident, maybe we should just try and _repress_ it, like a normal family.

I'm about to embark on a new journey.

Maybe you could _pave the way_ so that I can apologize.

Things with your mom got pretty intense down there, huh? All like East Coast-West Coast. You fellin' me?

I think concerts are _rad_.

Boys get urges.

Just talking to some dork I met in a _malt_ shop.

Just in the hood.

Promising career.

The _sarcasm_ is so hurtful, like a _whip_.

Because it may be the last time you ever see me.

Un, like a _lumberjack_?

No, he logs blood samples into a _cholesterol_ study.

Anyway, until I'm past this whole wedding _debacle_, I can't be intimate with him.

Oh, my little comet.

Oh, _karma's funny thing_, that's all.

If you bothered to get to know him.

He set a kid's bike on fire.

Oh, I might have told him to get even with some kids and he went all Rambo with it.

She's back from the grave.

She's a wreck about what happened at the wedding.

Still her little _errand_ boy, I see.

I'm just trying to piece this family back together.

Gloria would nerver go for that in a million years.

She's still furious about your mother.

I would love to get this thing behind us, but Gloria would nerver forgive me if I _pulled a fast one on her_.

I'm taking a nap.

He may burn your house down.

So you just _spring it on Gloria_ like this?

If I were you, I'd want to punch me right in the mouth.

It's not a good color on you.

I wanna rip your head off.

We grew apart for years.

You're reaching out, trying to hold on to something awesome.

Guy dudes and nutty people.

Not a chance in hell.
