I was supposed to keep a journal all summer.

I thought we have a _raccoon_.

_Let's get going._

It's a traditional Colombia _poncho_.

Am I driving him to school or is he gonna ride his burro?

You are a cutie pie.

Are you still baby-proofing?

Everything we own is _pointy_.

Clearly she's Diana Ross from the R.C.A years.

How is Daddy not seeing that?

I guess I'm a somewhat of a _shutterbug_.

Honey, you moving out?

Here, I will help you carry it out to the curb.

Come on! This covers up more than my bathing suit.

Can't he pick me up someplace else?

Haley just got her learner's permit.

Okay, merge.

This navigation system is all messed up.

Makes you realize we're all just handing by a thread.

Niagara Falls and log rides.

I wear all sort of daring outfits all the time.

I just think it's a little _over-the-top_.

You need to lossen up and have fun.

Did you put _hair spary_ on this?

Put a little _boogie_ in it.

So you ate your way to it?

I made a judgement call.

So she can be all judgemental and _condescending_?

Usually we just _give time-outs._

We just kind of _bonked_ Lily's head.

Load up the car.

I just dropped Manny off at school.

And I was hoping we'd still have a few more good years before the mind started to go.

Jay's very _spontaneous_.

He's always surprising me with little presents, _fun getaways_.

And maybe by my third marriage, I'll _have it down pat_.

I've _been meaning to_ get to it for a while.

Don't you have _an open house_ this morning?

Thought you might like some company.

The nest is empty.

They are _ruddlerless_.

I wear my special shoes with _the big soles_.
