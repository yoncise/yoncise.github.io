title: WARP Now Supports ARM
---
A couple of months ago, I wanted to use WARP to access ChatGPT, so I tried to install WARP on my Oracle VPS but failed because my VPS's architecture is ARM.

Last weekend, I tried again unintentionally and found that WARP now supports ARM. Here are the steps to run WARP in SOCKS mode:

1. Follow the instructions at [https://pkg.cloudflareclient.com/](https://pkg.cloudflareclient.com/) to install WARP.
2. Register the client: `warp-cli register new`.
3. Set the mode to proxy: `warp-cli set-mode proxy`.
   1. Change the listening port, which defaults to 40000: `warp-cli set-proxy-port <port>`.
4. Connect: `warp-cli connect`.
5. Verify that WARP is ON: `curl --socks5 127.0.0.1:40000 https://www.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/trace/`
