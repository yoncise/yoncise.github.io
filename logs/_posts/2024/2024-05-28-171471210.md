title: New Objective
---
Today, I've set a new objective: to write daily logs about my life, programming, trading, and everything in between. Why? First, our memory isn't always reliable, which is why it's important to jot things down. Second, I need to practice my English, and I believe that expressing oneself in English is an effective method.

This is my first log in English. Simply writing in English isn't enough, as it's obvious that I'll make mistakes. Thankfully, ChatGPT is incredibly helpful in assisting me to refine my text to be more accessible to native English speakers.

After trying out some writing prompts I found through Google, the prompt I've settled on to enhance this log is:
```
I'd like you to look at the following text I wrote and edit it to make it sound more natural to a native English speaker. Do only minimal/minor edits without changing the tone of the text, which should remain plain. Here's the text:

<text>
