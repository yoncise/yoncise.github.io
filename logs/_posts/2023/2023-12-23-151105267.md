You are just in time to catch the end of the game.

Dylan! D-Money! Chillin' with Dytlan the _villain_!

I thought you were gonna take out the garbage.

I was just being _facetious_.

Sit it. Park it.

How you and Hayley doing?

You gotta be familiar with _airfoil_, drag, lift and _thrust_ and these are all principles of _aerodynamics_.

"_Wrestle_." You wrestle. You can't box with _alligators_.

How would they get the gloves on those little claws.

We're just gonna buy some _diaplers_.

Mitchell is _snob_.

I'm _discerning_. Official slogan for snobs.

When we first met, he wouldn't even look at me because I was a _hick_ from the farm in Missouri, and he's a big city mouse.

Who says "city mouse"? Country mice.

Can you grab the garbage?

He's a little _jumpy_.

Oh, go figure a teenage boy doesn't want to hang out with his girfriend's dad.

You still _walk on eggshells around him_.

Jay and I are total buds.

You use strategy to expand _territories_ and take over the world.

He's out back playing.

Jay and I are buds, for sure, but with kind of an invisible asterisk.

Once he ran over my foot with his car.

It's not really her thing.

Your thing is to _provoke_.

The thing about me and Jay is our relationship's always been stuck in that primal place where is started.

He's the old silverback protecting his femalse, then along comes this younger, stronger _gorilla_ swinging in, beating his chest.

The _ape_ lades come running, presenting their nice _scarlet_ behinds.

The enemy is _poachers_.

Now we can open that general store.

We had a saying on the farm: As long as you're bringing the _mule_ to the market...

I feel you _rolling your eyes at me_.

I would get a little _boisterous_.

We were playing _charades_.

Without missing a beat.

The paper _shredder_ I wanted. Confetti and crosscut.

Those cookies smell like heaven. Your own recipe?

Added the secret ingredient of caring?

Two girls out for an afternoon fun.

Adults always say that, but they don't mean it.

Can you do a loop-de-loop?

There's another trick called "threading the needle."

You grab one of those _hoops_ over there.

I get chance flying it?

Alex and I can't just disagree. I mean, she has to turn everything into a fight.

I was nerver _hostile_ though.

I won't give up being myself for being a second.

They sell _baby formula_ and they sell _coffins_.

The sell _shed_.

I'm in the applesauce _aisle_.

I'm big, I'm not fancy and I dare you to not like me.

That's _gross_.

Let's go back to your _piercings_.

The cute _busboy_ doesn't know that you're smart.
