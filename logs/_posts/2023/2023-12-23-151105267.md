You are just in time to catch the end of the game.

Dylan! D-Money! Chillin' with Dytlan the _villain_!

I thought you were gonna take out the garbage.

I was just being _facetious_.

Sit it. Park it.

How you and Hayley doing?

You gotta be familiar with _airfoil_, drag, lift and _thrust_ and these are all principles of _aerodynamics_.

"_Wrestle_." You wrestle. You can't box with _alligators_.

How would they get the gloves on those little claws.

We're just gonna buy some _diaplers_.

Mitchell is _snob_.

I'm _discerning_. Official slogan for snobs.

When we first met, he wouldn't even look at me because I was a _hick_ from the farm in Missouri, and he's a big city mouse.

Who says "city mouse"? Country mice.

Can you grab the garbage?

He's a little _jumpy_.

Oh, go figure a teenage boy doesn't want to hang out with his girfriend's dad.

You still _walk on eggshells around him_.

Jay and I are total buds.
