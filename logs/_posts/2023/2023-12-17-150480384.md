What's the key to being a great dad?

Giving them the freedom to be whatever they want to be. Whether that's a painter, a poet, a pilot, a president of a company or of a country.

The two-bedroom cottage with the indoor-outdoor family room.

It's _creepy_.

I'm a real estate mogul.

We _caravanned_ that house.

Who is coconuts enough to divorce you?

He spilled a soda on my computer.

I'm all for teaching him a lesson.

But I worry about the _ridicule_ he might get from some loudmouth bully.

He looks like Little Bo Peep on that thing.

Sometimes a man's gotta put his foot down and do what a man's gotta do.

It's a _toddler_ play class, not a flight to Cabo.

Wow! _Paisley_ and pink.

Was there something wrong with _the fishnet tank top_.

I don't wanna rub anyone the wrong way.

I'll just go put on a pair of _khakis_, maybe a polo shirt.

I called that place in Nap and got us upgraded to a villa with a _hot tub_.

He keeps us grounded.

_Limo_ gets here at 4:00.

In my culture, men take great pride in doing physical labor.

Your words, not mine.

Don't make us look like jerks here.

Have, like, three _butt-loads_ of fun.

I'm gonna tie a _noose_ on this thing.

If you have two stubborn _burros_ that don't like each other, you tie them to the same cart.

Failure to _heed_ these warnings can lead to serious injury or death.

He's a total _flake_.

It's appointment viewing.

I do a pretty good Claire.

Which gives me more time to _grill_.

Who wants to _start us off_?

_Dance us in_, P.J.!

Is she grabbing or _scooting_ yet?

_Tamp down_ my natural gifts.

But that's how I make my horsey go.

I locked myself out of my house.

Would I ever act on it?

_Calloused_ hands.

Someone swiped it from me.

_Zinger_!

So, any chance I could _get a break on_ this one?

So, you wanna go for the insurance this time, or is it still for suckers?

Well played, _milord_.

I will take some insurance.

If I went out to the garage, took a picture for a _scrapbook_, there'd be no surprises?

I scratched it on my way into the _driveway_.

Who _boosted_ who through a bedroom window.

You gave me the wrong _screwdriver_.

I got a _two-seater_ parked in the driveway.

Why are you trying to _sneak_ around and hide things from me?

It's _hilarious_.

I just love ya so _darn_ much.
