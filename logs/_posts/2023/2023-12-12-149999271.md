Why are you guys yelling at us when we are _way_ upstairs?

Luke got his head stuck in the _banister_ again.

Gloria, they are _O_ and 6. Let's _take it down a notch_.

He spent the first half with his hand in his pants!

I've wanted to tell her off for last six weeks.

We just adopted her from Vietnam

We had initially asked one of out lesiban friends to be a _surrogate_

No, thank you. _Ick_.

Everybody _fawning over Lily_, and then you walk on and suddenly it's all, "Ooh, Sky Mall. I gotta buy a _motorized tie rack_."

This baby would have grown up in a crowded _orphanage_ if it wasn't for us "_cream puffs_"

Note to all of you who judge.

Love knows no race, _creed_ or gender.

We would like to pay for everyone's _headsets_.

_Excalibur_.

I'm having a friend over today

Fight in the sun.

I might as well just tell him not come.

Charge the _camcoder_.

I'm _hip_.

They're only plastic BBs.

Deal with this.

And now you have to follow through.

You know, Gloria, that little blowup with that other mom.

Cause that's where you live, down here. But I live up here.

You're gonna be swinging from the _flagpole_ in your _puffy white underpants_.
