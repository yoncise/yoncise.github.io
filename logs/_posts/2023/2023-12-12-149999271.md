Why are you guys yelling at us when we are _way_ upstairs?

Luke got his head stuck in the _banister_ again.

Gloria, they are _O_ and 6. Let's _take it down a notch_.

He spent the first half with his hand in his pants!

I've wanted to tell her off for last six weeks.

We just adopted her from Vietnam

We had initially asked one of out lesiban friends to be a _surrogate_

No, thank you. _Ick_.

Everybody _fawning over Lily_, and then you walk on and suddenly it's all, "Ooh, Sky Mall. I gotta buy a _motorized tie rack_."

This baby would have grown up in a crowded _orphanage_ if it wasn't for us "_cream puffs_"

Note to all of you who judge.

Love knows no race, _creed_ or gender.

We would like to pay for everyone's _headsets_.

_Excalibur_.

I'm having a friend over today

Fight in the sun.

I might as well just tell him not come.

Charge the _camcoder_.

I'm _hip_.

They're only plastic BBs.

Deal with this.

And now you have to follow through.

You know, Gloria, that little blowup with that other mom.

Cause that's where you live, down here. But I live up here.

You're gonna be swinging from the _flagpole_ in your _puffy white underpants_.

She barely slept on the plane and she's still _wide awake_.

What the hell is that supposed to mean?

But apparently your body does _a nesting, very maternal, primal thing_...where it retains nutrients some sort of _molecular physiology thing_.

We are floating above her, always there to protect her.

We _tore_ you away from everything you know.

Your fathers are floating _faires_.

I _invited them over_ for dinner tonight.

You're an _avoider_

Let me meet this "_playa_".

I could defeat you if it came to _a physical confrontation_.

I put my thoughts into word and now my words into action.

You ever see a _bullfighter_?

And I don't care what some _jackass_ in a pair of _ripped jeans_ thinks about me.

Stop being _a gloomy goose_.

And I can smell that _hair goo_ of his from here.

She gave me a picture of me as an old-time _sheriff_.

Let's get a _pretzel_.

We ask that alll mall-walkers stay to the right.

You wanna help me with the _frosting_?

Would you ever pretend she has a _mono_ for few a months?

This senior at school was "out sick" for four months, but Jenna Resnick swears she saw her breast-feeding as _a coin-op car wash_.

And how awesome would it be to have a fake little brother who's really my nephew.

So, _soak_ it.

I was just dropping off some laundry.

the next you're lying underneath the air hockey table with your bra in your pocket.
